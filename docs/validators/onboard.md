# Receive delegations from Drop
![image](https://github.com/hadronlabs-org/drop-docs/assets/103267218/b1fdd58e-408b-4d3d-96fd-c3f66f2cf50d)

To receive protocol delegations from Drop, validators must first onboard to the protocolâ€™s **Allow List** by applying during an onboarding wave. Onboarding waves are conducted on an ad-hoc basis to balance validator sustainability with protocol decentralization.

While Drop might conduct onboarding wave when a new network is onboarded, Dropâ€™s onboarding waves are not network-specific. As long as they continue to meet Dropâ€™s requirement on each network, validators that are onboarded to the protocolâ€™s **Allow List** are eligible for delegations across all supported network.

During an onboarding wave, validators must complete a three step process:

1. Ensure they meet Dropâ€™s requirements
2. Apply to join the **Allow List**
3. Maintain performance requirements 

### 1. Ensure that your validator meets Dropâ€™s requirements

To be eligible for protocol delegations, validators must continue to meet the following requirements:

- Operate their own infrastructure
- Have commissions set between 5% and 10% included
- Maintain >95% uptime over the last 90 days period
- Avoid jailing, slashing or tombstoning.

Validators operated by or affiliated with Centralized Exchanges or Custodian service providers are not eligible to Dropâ€™s protocol delegations. 

### 2. Apply to join the **Allow List** during an Onboarding Wave

> ðŸ’¡ As part of the onboarding process, Drop may request information considered sensitive by your organization.
> Please only share what you are able to, and note that any information shared in this process will be kept confidential by Drop.

Dropâ€™s first onboarding wave will open on `June 17th` and close on `June 28th` 2024 at midnight UTC. To apply, validators must simply submit a complete and faithful application via the appropriate form:

- [Wave 1](https://forms.gle/wYdAj5zUjjAWQc7Z7)

Drop contributors will review your application and confirm your eligibility to the protocolâ€™s **Allow List** based on the aforementioned requirements.

If youâ€™ve missed the first onboarding wave, make sure to follow [@Dropdotmoney](https://x.com/dropdotmoney) on X to be notified of future onboarding waves opening. 

### 3. Maintain performance requirements

Once onboarded to the **Allow List**, your validator will be eligible to receive protocol delegations from Drop. At launch, to balance stake distribution and operational overhead, Drop will delegate to the top 30 validators in the **Allow List** by voting power. As the protocol grows, the number of delegation slots may increase. 

To remain in the **Allow List**, your validator will be expected to maintain a high degree of reliability and performance:

- Maintain >95% uptime,
- Maintain a commission rate between 5% and 10% included,
- Avoid jailing, slashing or tombstoning.

Operators that fail to maintain high uptime, or are slashed, jailed or tombstoned will be removed from the **Allow List**. They can re-apply at the next onboarding wave, once underperformance has been resolved.
