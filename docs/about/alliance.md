# Lido Alliance

Drop was built by ex-Lido contributors and is an inaugural member of the [Lido Alliance](https://research.lido.fi/t/lido-alliance-an-ethereum-aligned-ecosystem/7475), which gives Drop access to greater distribution, liquidity, networking opportunities, and strategic/technical insights via Lido.

As a Lido Alliance member, Drop aims to further Lidoâ€™s mission by:

* Sponsoring the decentralization of Ethereum ecosystem dependencies such as bridges and data-availability layers (such as Celestia)
* Sponsoring innovation and experimentation that benefits Lido and Ethereum
* Supporting distribution and use cases for wstETH in the Interchain
* Sponsoring the adoption of wstETH as restaking collateral in the Interchain
