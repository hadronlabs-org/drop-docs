Drop is a cross-chain liquid staking protocol built as an Integrated Application on the [Neutron](https://www.neutron.org/) network. Drop is a trustless protocol consisting of [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) contracts controlling the flow of assets between multiple blockchains using IBC, [Interchain Transactions](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-txs/overview) and [Interchain Queries](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-queries/overview). Upon receipt of supported assets, the protocol mints liquid staking receipt tokens using the [Token Factory](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/3rdparty/osmosis/tokenfactory/overview) standard.

For liquid staking or referral integrations, see the [Integration guide](/integrations/overview.md).
