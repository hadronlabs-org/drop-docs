## What is Drop, and how does it work?

Drop is a liquid staking protocol for Interchain assets and a member of the [Lido](https://lido.fi/) Alliance. 
Led by ex-Lido and [P2P](https://p2p.org/) contributors, Drop is on a mission to strengthen the economic viability of sovereign blockchain economies by transforming stagnant, frozen capital into flowing streams of opportunity.

Built as an Integrated Application on [Neutron](https://www.neutron.org/), Drop’s smart contract architecture leverages the [Inter-Blockchain Communication](https://ibc.cosmos.network/main) (IBC) protocol and Neutron’s [Interchain Transactions](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-txs/overview) (ICTX) and [Interchain Queries](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/interchain-queries/overview) (ICQ) modules, enabling the protocol to provide trust-minimized liquid staking services and scale with minimal additional overhead and risk. 
Drop’s architecture consists of [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/) contracts controlling the flow of assets between multiple blockchains using IBC, ICTX, and ICQ. 
Upon receipt of supported assets, the protocol mints liquid staking receipt tokens (called dAssets) using the [Token Factory](https://docs.neutron.org/neutron/modules/3rdparty/osmosis/tokenfactory/overview) standard.

## dAssets

dAssets like dATOM and dTIA are secure, liquid representations of staked ATOM and TIA positions.

Traditional staking involves locking your assets with a validator for a period of time in exchange for staking rewards. While staking, you can’t transfer, sell, or use your assets. Liquid staking with Drop via dAssets allows you to:

* Earn staking rewards without locking your assets
* Deploy your staked assets in various applications for additional yield and benefits
* Auto-compound your staking rewards
* Exit your position at any time
* Remain eligible for airdrops
* Support the growth of your favorite ecosystems
* Earn DROP tokens through the [Droplet Program](https://medium.com/drop-protocol/introducing-the-droplets-program-the-ultimate-guide-to-earning-drop-d80fd58c6a3e)
